For training, compile and run the main function in main_RL.cpp

For inference, compile and run the main function in main_BP.cpp

Please make sure the methods in lines 51-58 of BP.cpp are using the correct "meth" values. All these methods can be simulated serially by launching a single instance of the main program.

For quantization, use Llyod Max quantizer such as this one: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38053-lloyd-max-quantizer-plots-mse

For GI scheduling, compute the GIs according to scheme discussed in the NIPS paper, and load them into the program for each code.

All the matrices, corresponding clusters and Q-tables used for generating the results in the NIPS papper are included in separate folders.
